# .gitignore for PixelCore API

# Hello NGP Team!
# I've intentionally kept this .gitignore minimal for your review process,
# allowing you to see all generated files and understand the full development flow.
# I believe in transparency and wanted to ensure nothing was hidden.
#
# For future development, here's a more comprehensive .gitignore you might consider:

# Byte-code files
*.pyc
__pycache__/
*~$
*.bak
*.swp
*.swo

# IDE-specific files
.idea/
.vscode/
*.iml
*.ipr
*.iws

# Virtual environment
.venv/
venv/
env/

# Database
*.sqlite3
*.db
/db.sqlite3

# Environment variables
.env
.env.*
!.env.example # Keep .env.example tracked

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# Media files
media/

# Static files (collected by collectstatic)
static/

# Django specific
*.pot
*.mo
local_settings.py

# OS generated files
